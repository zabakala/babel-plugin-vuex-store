- vue-typescript-class-without-imports - plugin not applied

- try changing module : ['nested', 'counter'] to 'nested/counter'
    - but there si the problem when -base- app adds duplicate identifier, i.e. /total/total
- try adding vxm_..(mutation) but convert it to () => { this.$store.commit('...')} in the background
    - but this.$store may not be available everywhere

- it would be good to process them before moving forward with with/without imports
    - use commons dir for share code for with/without imports



use ts in vue.file via <script lang="ts" .. to se if the plugin works as expected

// unit tests
      // - toCamelCase
      // - addCamelCaseValueToSnakeCaseKey
    // split main plugin file into smaller logical blocks/files

//
plugins run before presets

//
with & without imports / """ how to implement <  inside methods so that we can inspect its parent only and transform
    or inside data() {} and then travers inside methods? ... and what about transforms inside template?

plugin
 -> plugin from ./.babelrc
 -> node_modules/.bin/webpack
nuxt
 -> plugin from ./vue-nuxt/.babelrc
 -> npm run dev
 -> npm run generate (prod build)
typescript
typescript-class
 -> ../../../node_modules/.bin/tsc whenever a .ts file changes
 -> node_modules/.bin/webpack
    -> @babel/plugin-transform-typescript removes typescript and then the custom plugin kicks in
